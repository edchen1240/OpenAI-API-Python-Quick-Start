# OpenAI API Python Quick Start

## Introduction
Welcome to the OpenAI API Python Quick Start Guide, tailored for those new to coding or looking to save time on their initial foray. 
- This guide simplifies your journey into using OpenAI's API, highlighting key benefits over web-based interactions. 
- With the API, you gain access to potentially newer models and exclusive features not available on the standard web interface. Additionally, it offers enhanced privacy for your interactions. Most importantly, the API enables you to integrate ChatGPT's capabilities into your own custom applications, opening up a world of creative possibilities.

## Content
- OpenAI_API_0_module\.py:
    A function bank to store function and make the main codes easier to read.
- OpenAI_API_1_text\.py:
    Code for submitted text question written in .txt file.
- OpenAI_API_2_text+image\.py:
    Code for submitted text question written in .txt file, and a image file (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .bmp, or .gif').

## Requirement
1. Install python (recommended), or use Google Colab.
2. Apply for OpenAI API key at official website.
3. Install necessary libraries in OpenAI_API_0_module\.py.

## Step
1. Download three python files in the same folder.
2. Create a .txt question file (in any directory) with questions inside.
3. Run the code OpenAI_API_1_text, and select the question in the popout file dialog. 
(If you run OpenAI_API_2_text+image, the first file dialog will ask for text file, and the second file dialog will ask for image file.)
4. If the code prints out some part of the question for preview, and stay there for a few second, that means it's working and OpenAI is generating reply.
5. When you see "Complete", the reply has been received, append to the original question, and save. You can now open and check the reply.
